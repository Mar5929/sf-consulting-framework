## CLAUDE.md Structure

Generate with the **14-section structure** below, tailored for the Salesforce engagement based on interview answers. Use HTML comment placeholders (`<!-- -->`) for values not yet known.

### Section 1 — Project Overview
- Client Name, Project Name, One-line description
- Entry point (Greenfield / Build / Managed Services / Rescue)
- Salesforce products in scope
- Org type and environment path (Scratch → Dev → QA → UAT → Prod)
- Team size and roles (lead architect, developers, admins, consultants)
- Engagement timeline
- Linear Project ID: `{project-id}` (from Phase 4 auto-creation)
- Linear Project Name: `{Client Name} - {Project Name}`
- Scratch Org Alias: `{scratch-org-alias}` (from interview Round 2)
- QA Org Alias: `{qa-org-alias}` (from interview Round 2)

### Section 2 — Golden Rules
The 16 Golden Rules (confirmed or modified during interview):
1. Bulkification — all Apex handles collections
2. No SOQL/DML in loops
3. Trigger handler pattern — one trigger per object, delegates to handler
4. Governor limit awareness — check Limits class, design for 200-record batches
5. CRUD/FLS enforcement — WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED or stripInaccessible
6. With/without sharing — default `with sharing`, document every `without sharing`
7. Test coverage 85%+ — test bulk operations, assert outcomes
8. Metadata-first — prefer declarative over code
9. SLDS compliance — all LWC use Lightning Design System
10. Data classification — mark custom fields with sensitivity level
11. Ask before modifying object model
12. CPU time budget — monitor, use Queueable/Batch for heavy processing
13. Naming conventions — follow `references/naming-conventions.md`

Plus any engagement-specific rules from the interview.

14. **Living Document Sync** — All living documents (REQUIREMENTS, BACKLOG, TECHNICAL_SPEC, wiki pages, COMPONENT_REGISTRY) must be kept in sync. Update all affected docs when modifying code. Never leave a document stale.
15. **Component Registry & Manifest Updates (Non-Negotiable)** — Every component create/modify/delete must update both `docs/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` and `docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml` immediately. Update `docs/domains/{domain-id}.md` if domain scope or dependencies change.
16. **UI Testing with Playwright** — Before starting UI work (LWC, FlexCard, Experience Cloud page), ask user: "This involves UI work. Should I use the Playwright screenshot loop?" If yes, follow build → screenshot → review → iterate loop.

### Section 5 — Coding Standards

**Apex:**
- Trigger handler pattern (one trigger → handler class)
- Bulkification (all methods handle `List<SObject>`)
- SOQL: SELECT only needed fields, use WHERE clauses, WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED
- DML: collect records, single DML outside loops
- Error handling: try/catch with meaningful messages, custom exceptions
- Null safety: always check for null before operations
- Governor limits: check `Limits.getQueries()` in complex operations

**LWC:**
- Wire service for read operations, imperative for write operations
- SLDS classes for all styling (no custom CSS that conflicts with SLDS)
- Error handling with `reduceErrors()` utility
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- Reactive properties with `@track` only when needed (most are reactive by default)

**Flows:**
- Naming: `Object_Action_Description` (e.g., `Account_Before_ValidateAddress`)
- Document purpose in Flow description
- Use subflows for reusable logic
- Error handling with fault paths

**Metadata:**
- API names: PascalCase for objects (`Custom_Object__c`), camelCase for fields (`customField__c`)
- Follow `references/naming-conventions.md` for complete standard

### Section 8 — Session Startup Checklist

**Do these steps automatically at the start of every session:**

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — Sections 1, 2, 5, and 9 at minimum
2. Read `docs/CODE_ATLAS.md` — Apex classes, triggers, LWC, flows
3. Read `docs/BACKLOG.md` — open work items and sprint structure
4. Skim `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` if working on a feature
5. **Pull Linear tickets** — Use Linear MCP to find the project (ID in Section 1), then list all open (non-completed) issues grouped by milestone. Cross-reference with BACKLOG.md for BL-IDs.
6. **Identify current sprint** — Determine which phase/sprint has incomplete items. Present:
   - Current sprint or phase name
   - All open work items for that sprint (BL-ID, Linear issue title, priority, status)
   - Which items are ready to build (prerequisites met, requirements documented)
7. Ask: "Which item would you like to start with, or should I work through [current sprint] in order?"

**When working on a specific item, use the Component Manifest Retrieval Protocol instead of reading all source:**

1. **Scope** — Read the `domains:` section of `docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml` (~50 lines). Identify 1-3 relevant domains for the work item.
2. **Domain Context** — Read `docs/domains/{domain-id}.md` for those domains (50-100 lines each).
3. **Components** — Grep the manifest for domain-specific components: `grep "domain: {domain-id}" docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml`
4. **Dependencies** — If cross-domain dependencies are found, load additional domain context files.
5. **Source Code** — Only now read actual `force-app/` files — and only the specific ones identified.

This loads 200-500 lines of context vs. 3000-6000 for the full registry.

### Section 9 — Git Commit Protocol
- Format: `feat(BL-XXX): Short summary`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `config`
- Rules: one commit per backlog item, include doc updates in same commit
- Branching: GitFlow (or whatever was selected)

### Section 10 — Clarification Protocol
Always clarify before proceeding:
- Object model changes (new objects, fields, relationships)
- Sharing rule modifications
- Security settings (profiles, permission sets, OWD changes)
- Integration endpoints and authentication
- Data migration mappings
- Anything contradicting `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`

### Section 11 — Context Window Management
1. Don't re-read files already read this session
2. Reference by path: "see `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` REQ-003"
3. Use `docs/` as external memory
4. Use Context7 MCP for Apex/LWC/SFDX documentation
5. Fall back to `references/salesforce-well-architected.md` for architectural guidance

### Section 12 — Bug-Prevention Facts
Empty at project start. Populated during development.

### Section 13 — References

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| `references/salesforce-well-architected.md` | Curated Well-Architected framework reference |
| Context7 MCP | Live Apex, LWC, SFDX CLI documentation |
| `references/naming-conventions.md` | Firm naming standard |
| architect.salesforce.com | Official Well-Architected patterns |

### Section 14 — Work Item Execution Loop

**When the user selects a work item (or says "go in order"), follow this loop for each item:**

1. **Update Linear** — Set the issue status to "In Progress"
2. **Branch** — `git checkout -b feature/BL-XXX-short-description develop`
3. **Pre-implementation check** — For complex features, invoke the sf-architect-solutioning skill. For simple items (fields, config, minor changes), proceed directly.
4. **TDD** — Write the test class first with expected behaviors and assertions, then implement until all tests pass. Test-first is the default; skip only for pure metadata/declarative work (fields, page layouts, flows).
5. **Test** — `sf apex run test --target-org {scratch-org-alias} --result-format human --code-coverage`
6. **Validate** — `sf project deploy validate --target-org {qa-org-alias} --test-level RunLocalTests`
7. **Update docs** — Per Section 4: COMPONENT_REGISTRY, COMPONENT_MANIFEST, domain context files, CODE_ATLAS, CHANGELOG, DATA_MODEL (if objects touched), and any affected wiki pages
8. **Commit** — `feat(BL-XXX): Short summary` per Section 9. Include doc updates in the same commit.
9. **Update Linear** — Set the issue status to "Done"
10. **Next item** — Present the next sprint item and begin again from step 1. Continue until the user says stop or the sprint backlog is complete.

**Notes:**
- If a test fails at step 5, fix the implementation and re-run — do not skip or reduce coverage.
- If validation fails at step 6, diagnose the issue, fix it, and re-validate.
- If a work item is blocked (missing requirements, dependency on another item), mark it `BLOCKED` in both BACKLOG.md and Linear, skip it, and move to the next item.

## Design Standards Template

Template for `wiki/ways-of-working/design-standards.md`, generated during scaffolding.

### Structure (Two-Layer)

**Layer 1 — Framework Defaults** (always included):

```markdown
# Design Standards

## Framework Defaults

These standards apply to all Salesforce engagements unless overridden by client-specific standards below.

### The 16 Golden Rules
1. Bulkification — all Apex handles collections
2. No SOQL/DML in loops
3. Trigger handler pattern — one trigger per object, delegates to handler
4. Governor limit awareness — check Limits class, design for 200-record batches
5. CRUD/FLS enforcement — WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED or stripInaccessible()
6. With/without sharing — default with sharing, document every without sharing
7. Test coverage 85%+ — test bulk operations, assert outcomes
8. Metadata-first — prefer declarative over code
9. SLDS compliance — all LWC use Lightning Design System
10. Data classification — mark custom fields with sensitivity level
11. Ask before modifying object model
12. CPU time budget — monitor, use Queueable/Batch for heavy processing
13. Naming conventions — follow firm standard
14. Living document sync — update all affected docs when modifying code
15. Component registry & manifest updates (non-negotiable) — every component change updates both registry and manifest
16. UI testing with Playwright — use screenshot loop for UI work when applicable

### Well-Architected Patterns
- **Trusted:** Security, performance, reliability
- **Easy:** User experience, admin experience, developer experience
- **Adaptable:** Scalable, flexible, maintainable

### Naming Conventions
[Reference to project's naming-conventions.md standard]

### Code Patterns
- Trigger Handler Dispatch for all triggers
- Service Layer for business logic
- Selector Pattern for SOQL queries
- Domain Layer for object-specific validation
- LWC Composition for component architecture
- Flow-vs-Code decision tree for automation choices
```

**Layer 2 — Client-Specific Standards** (populated during interview Round 8):

```markdown
## Client-Specific Standards

> These standards are specific to [Client Name] and override framework defaults where they conflict.

### Coding Standards
[Client-specific coding guidelines, if any]

### UI Standards
[Client-specific UI requirements — branding, accessibility level, supported browsers]

### Architectural Constraints
[Client-imposed constraints — no custom Apex in production, specific integration middleware, etc.]

### Documentation Standards
[Client-specific documentation requirements — format, naming, approval process]

### Review & Approval
[Client-specific review processes — CAB, code review requirements, deployment windows]
```

Bootstrap prompt for Claude:
- Read CLAUDE.md → CODE_ATLAS.md → BACKLOG.md
- Summary of engagement context
- Current phase and priority items

## COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml Schema

**Purpose:** Machine-readable component index for domain-based retrieval. Enables Claude to go from "user story about X" to "these 15 components are relevant" without reading everything.

**File location:** `docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml`

**Structure:**

```yaml
version: 1
last_updated: "[Date]"

# ── Domain Index ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Read this section first (~50 lines) to identify relevant domains.
# Then load only the domain context files you need.
domains:
  - id: [kebab-case-domain-id]
    label: "[Human-readable domain name]"
    description: "[One-line: what this domain covers]"
    products: [[salesforce-product-ids]]

# ── Components ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Grep this section by domain to find relevant components.
# Example: grep "domain: lead-management" docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml
components: []
# Each component entry:
#   - api_name: "ComponentApiName"
#     type: [apex_class | apex_trigger | flow | lwc | custom_object | custom_field |
#            permission_set | validation_rule | page_layout | custom_metadata_type |
#            platform_event | named_credential]
#     subtype: [service | handler | selector | domain | utility | test | batch |
#               schedulable | invocable | controller | record_triggered | screen |
#               scheduled | autolaunched | platform_event_triggered | junction_object |
#               lookup | master_detail | null]
#     domain: [domain-id]
#     purpose: "[One-line description]"
#     depends_on: [list of api_names this component calls or references]
#     depended_by: [list of api_names that call or reference this component]
#     requirements: [REQ-XXX ids]
#     backlog: [BL-XXX ids]
#     declarative_design: [pending | designed | approved | null]
#     status: [active | draft | deprecated | removed]
```

**Generation rules:**
- Pre-populate `domains:` from Round 3 product selections and Round 4 business process answers
- Leave `components:` as an empty list — populated during development
- Domain IDs use kebab-case (e.g., `lead-management`, `territory-management`)
- The `declarative_design` field applies only to declarative components (Flows, objects, validation rules, permission sets, etc.) and aligns with the "Declarative Design Status" column in the solutioning skill's Components table
- Non-declarative components (Apex, LWC) set `declarative_design: null`

---

## Domain Context File Template

**Purpose:** Short (50-100 line) retrieval-optimized summary per business domain. Claude reads these instead of scanning the full manifest or source.

**File location:** `docs/domains/{domain-id}.md`

**Template:**

```markdown
# Domain: [Domain Label]

## Business Purpose
[2-3 sentences: what this domain covers, key business processes, who uses it.]

## Key Objects
- [Object API Name] — [purpose]

## Key Automation
- [Trigger/Flow/Handler chain descriptions]

## Key UI
- [LWC/FlexCard/page descriptions]

## Dependencies on Other Domains
- **Reads from:** [domain-ids this domain consumes data from]
- **Writes to:** [domain-ids this domain pushes data to]

## Current Decisions
- [ADR-XXX references relevant to this domain]

## Open Issues
- [BL-XXX references for unresolved items in this domain]
```

**Generation rules:**
- Create one stub file per domain identified during the interview (Round 3 products + Round 4 business processes)
- Stub files have the template structure with placeholder text
- Keep files lean: summaries only, ~100 lines max. The manifest has the exhaustive component list.
- If client metadata conventions (from Round 8) apply to specific domains, note which domains have client-specific conventions that override Well-Architected defaults

## CODEOWNERS Template

Template for `.github/CODEOWNERS`. Generated during Phase 3 scaffolding, populated with GitHub handles from interview Round 1 team data.

```
# .github/CODEOWNERS
#
# Each line maps a path pattern to the GitHub users/teams who must approve PRs
# touching those paths. The LAST matching pattern takes precedence.
#
# Format: <path-pattern>  <owner1> <owner2> ...
# Replace @placeholder values with actual GitHub usernames or team handles.
#
# Activate by enabling "Require review from Code Owners" in GitHub
# Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules.
