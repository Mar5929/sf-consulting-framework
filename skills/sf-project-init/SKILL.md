description: >
  Initialize and scaffold a Salesforce consulting engagement with a structured 8-round expert
  interview, tailored CLAUDE.md, SFDX project structure, Linear project/issue auto-creation,
  and client deliverable templates. Use this skill whenever the user wants to start a new
  Salesforce client project, set up an SFDX workspace, begin a Salesforce discovery engagement,
  scaffold a Salesforce implementation, take over an existing Salesforce org, or set up managed
  services for a client org. Supports 4 entry points: greenfield/discovery, build phase, managed
  services, and rescue/takeover. Also trigger when the user says "new SF project", "Salesforce
  engagement", "client onboarding", "sf-project-init", "start a Salesforce project", or
  "initialize Salesforce workspace". Do NOT use for non-Salesforce projects — use project-init
  instead. Do NOT use for existing Salesforce projects that already have a CLAUDE.md and
  force-app/ structure in place.

# Salesforce Consulting Engagement Init

You are the **Salesforce engagement architect, technical lead, and onboarding interviewer**. Your job is to conduct a structured 8-round expert interview, then generate a complete Salesforce project scaffolding tailored to the engagement.

**Do NOT create any files until the interview is complete and the user approves the creation summary.**

---

## How This Skill Works

1. **Interview** (8 rounds) — Gather engagement context, org details, products, entry-point specifics, deliverables, dev standards, security, and conventions
2. **Summary & Approval** — Present everything that will be created, wait for user approval
3. **Generate** — Create SFDX project structure, CLAUDE.md, docs, deliverables folders, CI/CD templates, and Linear project
4. **Configure** — Set up MCP servers, Context7 references, and tool integrations

---

## Phase 1: The Interview

Conduct this as a **natural conversation** — ask **3-5 questions at a time**, wait for answers, then ask follow-ups. Do not dump all questions at once. Adapt based on answers — skip irrelevant topics, dig deeper into areas the user cares about.

Read the following reference files during the interview to provide informed questions and recommendations:
- `references/salesforce-well-architected.md` — architectural guidance
- `references/salesforce-products.md` — product-specific questions
- `references/entry-points.md` — entry-point-specific guidance
- `references/interview-adaptations.md` — logic for adapting interview depth

### Round 1 — Engagement Context

Ask these questions to establish the engagement:

- What is the **client name** and **project name**?
- What is your **role** on this engagement? (Lead architect, developer, admin, consultant)
- How large is the **consulting team**? Who else will be working in this repo?
- What is the **entry point** for this engagement?
  - **Discovery / Greenfield** — Starting from scratch, full requirements gathering
  - **Build Phase** — Requirements exist, jumping into development
  - **Managed Services** — Ongoing support and enhancements for an existing org
  - **Rescue / Takeover** — Taking over from a previous vendor, audit and remediation focus

Based on the entry point, read `references/entry-points.md` for guidance on what to ask, skip, and prioritize in subsequent rounds.

### Round 2 — Org & Environment

> **Skip for Managed Services** — ask a lighter version focused on current org state.

- What type of Salesforce org? (Production, Sandbox, Scratch Org, Developer Edition)
- Is there an **existing org** with data/config, or starting fresh?
- What is the **environment promotion path**? (e.g., Scratch → Dev Sandbox → QA → UAT → Prod)
- Will you use **scratch orgs** for development? (Recommend yes for source-tracked development)
- Is this a **multi-org** environment? (e.g., separate orgs for different business units)

### Round 3 — Products & Scope

Read `references/salesforce-products.md` for product-specific interview questions.

- Which **Salesforce clouds/products** are involved? Present the list and let the user select:
  - [ ] Sales Cloud
  - [ ] Service Cloud
  - [ ] Experience Cloud
  - [ ] Marketing Cloud
  - [ ] Data Cloud
  - [ ] Revenue Cloud / CPQ
  - [ ] Industries / OmniStudio
  - [ ] MuleSoft
  - [ ] Tableau
- Are there any **AppExchange packages** or managed packages involved?
- What **integrations** with external systems are needed? (ERP, data warehouse, legacy systems, APIs)
- Is there a **data migration** component? (From legacy systems, CSV, ETL tools)
  - If yes: What are the source systems? Approximate data volumes? Transformation requirements?

For each selected product, ask the **targeted interview questions** from `references/salesforce-products.md`.

### Round 4 — Entry-Point Deep Dive

Read `references/entry-points.md` for this round. The questions are **fully adaptive** based on the entry point selected in Round 1.

**If Greenfield / Discovery:**
- What are the primary business processes to be supported?
- What are the current pain points with existing tools/processes?
- Who are the key stakeholders? What are their success criteria?
- What compliance or regulatory requirements exist? (HIPAA, SOX, PCI, GDPR)
- What is the expected timeline?

**If Build Phase:**
- Where are the existing **requirements documents**? (BRD, user stories, design docs)
- Has a **solution design** been completed? By whom?
- What is the **sprint cadence**? (Recommend 2-week sprints)
- Are **environments** already set up? What state are they in?
- Is there an existing **CI/CD pipeline**?

**If Managed Services:**
- What are the current **org health concerns**? Known tech debt?
- What are the **SLA terms**? (Response time, resolution time, coverage hours)
- What is the **ticket/change request process**? (Email, portal, Jira, Linear)
- What is the **change management** process? (CAB, approval workflows)
- Are there existing **documentation or runbooks**?

**If Rescue / Takeover:**
- What is **broken** or at risk? (Specific issues, blockers, failed deployments)
- Who was the **previous vendor/team**? Is there a handoff?
- What is the **deployment history**? Recent changes that may have caused issues?
- Are there **data integrity concerns**? (Duplicate records, broken integrations, stale data)
- What is the **urgency level**? Are there critical fixes needed before systematic remediation?

### Round 5 — Deliverables & Docs

Read `references/document-templates.md` for template structures.

- Which **client deliverables** does the client expect? Present defaults based on entry point:

| Deliverable | Greenfield | Build | Managed | Rescue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Business Requirements Document (BRD) | Required | Review existing | Skip | Skip |
| Solution Design Document (SDD) | Required | Required | Skip | After audit |
| Data Migration Plan | If applicable | If applicable | Skip | If applicable |
| Test Plan & UAT Scripts | Required | Required | Lighter | Required |
| Architecture Diagrams (HTML) | Required | Required | Current state | Current + Target |
| Training Materials | Required | Required | Skip | Skip |
| Org Assessment | Skip | Skip | Required | Required |
| Rescue Assessment | Skip | Skip | Skip | Required |

- Should Claude **auto-create a Linear project** for this engagement? (Recommend yes)
  - If yes: confirm the team (default: Rihm), milestone structure based on entry point
- Which **living documents** should Claude maintain?
  - Recommend defaults: BACKLOG.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, TECHNICAL_SPEC.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md, DATA_MODEL.md, CODE_ATLAS.md, **COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md** (NON-OPTIONAL — always included)
- **Component Registry & Manifest** — `docs/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` and `docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml` are always generated. Explain: "The registry is a human-readable inventory of every component. The manifest is a machine-readable YAML index with domain tags that lets Claude quickly find relevant components without reading everything. Both are updated automatically whenever components are created, modified, or deleted. These are non-optional."
- **Daily Linear Sync** (opt-in) — Would you like a daily GitHub Actions workflow that syncs your Linear project state to BACKLOG.md? This keeps the backlog file current with Linear as the source of truth.
  - If yes: will generate `.github/workflows/linear-sync.yml` and `scripts/linear-sync.js`. Requires `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `LINEAR_TEAM_ID`, and `LINEAR_PROJECT_ID` as GitHub Secrets.

### Round 6 — Dev Standards & CI/CD

> **Skip some for Managed Services** — focus on deployment pipeline and code review.

- **Branching strategy** — recommend **GitFlow** for Salesforce engagements:
  - `main` — production-ready code, deploys to production
  - `develop` — integration branch, deploys to dev/QA sandbox
  - `feature/*` — individual features, validated via CI on PR
  - `hotfix/*` — emergency fixes from main
  - `release/*` — release candidates, deploys to UAT
  - Present alternatives: GitHub Flow (simpler), Trunk-based (for small teams)
- **GitHub repository** — Should Claude create the GitHub repository after scaffolding?
  - If yes: GitHub account or org name? Public or private? Repository name (default: kebab-case of project name, e.g., `acme-corp-service-cloud`)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — recommend enabling with these templates:
  - `sf-validate.yml` — validate PR against target org (runs on PR to develop/main)
  - `sf-deploy.yml` — deploy to target org (runs on merge to develop/main)
  - Read `references/cicd-templates.md` for the YAML templates
- **Code review policy** — require PR review before merge? Minimum reviewers?
- **Test coverage target** — Salesforce requires 75%, recommend **85%+**
- **Apex code standards** — accept the 16 Golden Rules as defaults? (see below)

### Round 7 — Security & Compliance

- What is the **data classification** for this org? (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
- Are there **compliance requirements**? (HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, FedRAMP)
- What is the **sharing model** strategy?
  - Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) per object?
  - Sharing rules, role hierarchy, territory management?
- Is **Salesforce Shield** / Platform Encryption in use or needed?
- Are there **field-level security** requirements beyond standard profiles/permission sets?

### Round 8 — Conventions & Preferences

Read `references/naming-conventions.md` for the default naming standard.

- **Naming conventions** — accept the firm standard from `references/naming-conventions.md`? Or customize?
  - Present the default standard and let the user confirm or modify
- **Communication style** — how should Claude communicate? (Brief and action-oriented recommended)
- **MCP server confirmations** — should Claude ask before using MCP tools? (Recommend: ask for destructive actions only)
- **Client design standards** — Does the client have specific design standards beyond Salesforce best practices? (Coding guidelines, UI standards, architectural constraints, documentation formats, approval processes)
  - If yes: capture these for `wiki/ways-of-working/design-standards.md` Layer 2 (client-specific)
  - If no: framework defaults (16 Golden Rules + Well-Architected patterns) will apply
- **Client metadata conventions** — Does the client have specific conventions for declarative metadata that differ from Salesforce Well-Architected defaults?
  - Flow conventions (fault handling, naming, description templates, subflow patterns)
  - Object/Field conventions (field prefixes, required fields on all custom objects, relationship naming)
  - Permission model (by feature vs. by role, required Permission Set Groups, profile lockdown)
  - Approval conventions (routing approach, notification templates)
  - Error handling (logging object, fault path patterns, notification channels)
  - If yes: capture for `## Client Metadata Conventions` section in CLAUDE.md
  - If no: Well-Architected defaults from `references/metadata/` apply exclusively
- Any **additional golden rules** or invariants specific to this engagement?

---

## The 16 Golden Rules

These are included in every generated CLAUDE.md. Present them during Round 6 for confirmation:

1. **Bulkification** — All Apex must handle collections, never single records
2. **No SOQL/DML in loops** — Query and DML operations outside loops, always
3. **Trigger handler pattern** — One trigger per object, delegates to handler class
4. **Governor limit awareness** — Check `Limits` class, design for 200-record batches
5. **CRUD/FLS enforcement** — Use `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED` or `stripInaccessible()`
6. **With/without sharing** — Default `with sharing`, document every `without sharing` use
7. **Test coverage 85%+** — Test bulk operations, assert outcomes not just no-exceptions
8. **Metadata-first** — Prefer declarative (Flows, validation rules) over custom code
9. **SLDS compliance** — All LWC must use Lightning Design System
10. **Data classification** — Mark custom fields with sensitivity level
11. **Ask before modifying object model** — Never create/modify objects, fields, or relationships without user confirmation
12. **CPU time budget** — Monitor in complex operations, use Queueable/Batch for heavy processing
13. **Naming conventions** — Follow firm standard from `references/naming-conventions.md`
14. **Living Document Sync** — All living documents (REQUIREMENTS, BACKLOG, TECHNICAL_SPEC, wiki pages, COMPONENT_REGISTRY) must be kept in sync. Update all affected docs when modifying code. Never leave a document stale.
15. **Component Registry & Manifest Updates (Non-Negotiable)** — Every component create/modify/delete must update both `docs/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` and `docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml` immediately. Update the relevant `docs/domains/{domain-id}.md` if domain scope or dependencies change.
16. **UI Testing with Playwright** — Before starting UI work (LWC, FlexCard, Experience Cloud page), ask user: "This involves UI work. Should I use the Playwright screenshot loop?" If yes, follow build → screenshot → review → iterate loop.

---

## Phase 3: Generate Scaffolding

After approval, generate the project. Read reference files for templates:
- `references/document-templates.md` — document structures
- `references/cicd-templates.md` — GitHub Actions YAML
- `references/naming-conventions.md` — naming standard
- `references/workflow-rules.md` — workflow rules for CLAUDE.md

### CLAUDE.md Generation

Generate with the **14-section structure** from `references/document-templates.md`, tailored for Salesforce:

**Section 1 — Project Overview:** Client name, project name, entry point, products in scope, team, org type
**Section 2 — Golden Rules:** The 16 Golden Rules (confirmed or modified in Rounds 6/8), plus any engagement-specific rules. Rules 14-16: Living Document Sync, Component Registry & Manifest Updates (Non-Negotiable), UI Testing with Playwright
**Section 3 — Workspace Structure:** SFDX directory tree with `force-app/`, `docs/`, `deliverables/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`
**Section 4 — Living Documents Update Protocol:** Event-to-action table for enabled documents (includes manifest and domain file update events)
**Section 5 — Coding Standards:** Salesforce-specific: Apex (bulkification, trigger handlers, SOQL best practices), LWC (wire vs imperative, SLDS, accessibility), Flows (naming, documentation)
**Section 6 — Tech Stack:** Salesforce Platform, SFDX CLI, VS Code, GitHub, GitHub Actions, selected products
**Section 7 — Key Commands:** SFDX commands grouped by: Org Management, Source Operations, Testing, Deployment
**Section 8 — Session Startup:** Read CLAUDE.md → CODE_ATLAS.md → BACKLOG.md → check `docs/.active-work.json` for active locks → ask what to work on. If `.active-work.json` shows another developer working on files in the same domain, warn: "[Developer] is currently working on [files] for [BL-ID]. Coordinate before modifying these files." Includes Component Manifest Retrieval Protocol for lazy-loading domain context when working on specific items
**Section 9 — Git Commit Protocol:** GitFlow format, `feat(BL-XXX): summary`
**Section 10 — Clarification Protocol:** Always clarify: object model changes, sharing rules, security settings, integrations
**Section 11 — Context Window Management:** Use docs as external memory, reference by path
**Section 12 — Bug-Prevention Facts:** Empty, populated during development
**Section 13 — References:** Link to Well-Architected, Context7, SFDX docs, product-specific guides

**Client Metadata Conventions (optional — only if client provided conventions in Round 8):**
```
## Client Metadata Conventions

These conventions layer on top of Salesforce Well-Architected defaults.
When a client convention conflicts with a default, the client convention wins.

### Flows
- [Client-specific flow conventions]

### Objects & Fields
- [Client-specific naming/structure conventions]

### Permission Model
- [Client-specific permission approach]

### Error Handling
- [Client-specific error patterns]
```

If the user has no client-specific conventions, omit this section entirely — Well-Architected defaults from `references/metadata/` apply exclusively.

**Context7 Integration:** Add to Section 13:
```
- Use Context7 MCP (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`) for live Apex, LWC, and SFDX CLI documentation
- Fall back to `references/salesforce-well-architected.md` for architectural guidance and anti-patterns
```

**MCP Server Instructions:** Add to CLAUDE.md:
```
## MCP Servers

### Required
- **salesforcecli/mcp** — Official Salesforce DX MCP. Use for: deploy, retrieve, run tests, manage scratch orgs via natural language
- **Linear MCP** — Issue tracking. Team: [team name], Project: [project name]
- **Context7 MCP** — Live documentation lookup for Apex, LWC, SFDX CLI
- **Playwright MCP** — Browser automation for UI testing and screenshot verification

### Optional
- **tsmztech/mcp-server-salesforce** — Community MCP for deeper SOQL queries, CRUD operations, and metadata API access
```

### SFDX Project Files

**sfdx-project.json:**
```json
{
  "packageDirectories": [{ "path": "force-app", "default": true }],
  "namespace": "",
  "sfdcLoginUrl": "https://login.salesforce.com",
  "sourceApiVersion": "62.0"
}
```

**config/project-scratch-def.json** (if scratch orgs enabled):
```json
{
  "orgName": "[Client] - [Project] Dev",
  "edition": "Developer",
  "features": [],
  "settings": {
    "lightningExperienceSettings": { "enableS1DesktopEnabled": true },
    "mobileSettings": { "enableS1EncryptedStoragePref2": false }
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Templates

Read `references/cicd-templates.md` and generate:
- `.github/workflows/sf-validate.yml`
- `.github/workflows/sf-deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docs-validate.yml` — always generated; protects docs PRs from accidental code changes

```

### Wiki Generation

Populate the `wiki/` directory based on interview answers:

1. **organization-overview.md** — Fill with client name, org type, team, timeline from Rounds 1-2
2. **ways-of-working/** — Populate from Rounds 6-8:
   - `design-standards.md` — Layer 1 (framework defaults: 16 Golden Rules + Well-Architected) always included. Layer 2 (client-specific) populated from Round 8 answers
   - `deployment-cicd.md` — From Round 6 branching strategy and CI/CD selections
   - `sandbox-strategy.md` — From Round 2 environment path
   - `team-makeup.md` — From Round 1 team information
   - `recurring-meetings.md` — Template with common defaults
   - `roadmap-timelines.md` — From Round 4 timeline and milestones
3. **applications/** — Create one subdirectory per product selected in Round 3:
   - Convert product names to kebab-case directory names (e.g., `sales-cloud/`, `service-cloud/`, `experience-cloud/`, `data-cloud/`, `revenue-cloud/`, `industries-omni/`, `custom-crm/`)
   - Each gets: `overview.md`, `technical-specs.md`, `requirements.md`, `process-flows.md`
   - Populate overview.md with product-specific context from the interview

### Component Registry Generation

Generate `docs/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` as an auto-generated summary file:
- Summary table with all categories at count 0
- Header comment: `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED — Do not edit directly. Update docs/registry/{domain-id}.md files instead. -->`
- This is **NON-OPTIONAL** — always generated regardless of user selections

Generate `docs/registry/` directory with one starter file per domain identified in the interview (same domains used for `docs/domains/`):
- Create `docs/registry/{domain-id}.md` for each domain using the template from `references/document-templates.md`
- Populate domain name and ID from interview answers
- Leave component tables empty — populated during development

### Component Manifest Generation

Generate `docs/COMPONENT_MANIFEST.yaml` with:
- Schema version and last_updated date
- `domains:` section pre-populated from Round 3 product selections and Round 4 business process answers. Map products and processes to domains using kebab-case IDs (e.g., `lead-management`, `opportunity-management`, `case-management`)
- Empty `components:` list — populated during development
- Read `references/document-templates.md` for the full YAML schema
- This is **NON-OPTIONAL** — always generated regardless of user selections

### Active Work Lock File Generation

Generate `docs/.active-work.json` with an empty locks array:
```json
{ "locks": [] }
```
This file is maintained automatically by the sf-develop skill — developers do not edit it manually.

### Sprint Changelog Generation

Generate the `docs/changelog/` directory:
- Create `docs/changelog/sprint-{project-start-date}.md` using the sprint changelog template from `references/document-templates.md`
- The sprint start date is derived from the engagement start date captured in the interview
- Add a header comment to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED — Do not edit directly. Update docs/changelog/sprint-YYYY-MM-DD.md files instead. -->`

### Domain Context Files Generation

Generate `docs/domains/{domain-id}.md` stub files:
- One file per domain identified in the manifest's `domains:` section
- Use the template from `references/document-templates.md`
- Populate Business Purpose from interview answers (Round 3 product context, Round 4 business processes)
- Leave Key Objects, Key Automation, Key UI sections as placeholders — populated during development
- If client metadata conventions (captured in Round 8 `## Client Metadata Conventions`) apply to specific domains, note which domains have client-specific conventions that override Well-Architected defaults

### CODEOWNERS Generation

Generate `.github/CODEOWNERS` using the template from `references/document-templates.md`:
- Replace `@dev-team` with developer GitHub usernames from Round 1
- Replace `@tech-lead` with the tech lead's GitHub username from Round 1
- Replace `@pm-team`, `@ba-team`, `@qa-team` with respective role handles from Round 1
- If a role has no team members, remove the corresponding lines
- If single-developer engagement: set all paths to that developer's username

### Linear Sync Generation

If the user opted in to daily Linear sync in Round 5:
- Generate `.github/workflows/linear-sync.yml` from `references/cicd-templates.md`
- Generate `scripts/linear-sync.js` from `references/cicd-templates.md`
- Add setup instructions to README.md (secrets required: LINEAR_API_KEY, LINEAR_TEAM_ID, LINEAR_PROJECT_ID)

---

## Phase 3.5: GitHub Repository Setup

After all files are generated, if the user opted in to GitHub repo creation during Round 6, execute the following:

### Step 1 — Initialize git and create initial commit

```bash
git init
git checkout -b develop        # GitFlow: develop is default working branch
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial project scaffolding — [Client] [Project]"
```

### Step 2 — Create GitHub remote repository

Use `gh repo create` to create the remote:

```bash
# Public repo (if selected)
gh repo create [repo-name] --public --source . --remote origin --push

# Private repo (if selected)
gh repo create [org/repo-name] --private --source . --remote origin --push
```

If the user specified a GitHub org, prefix with `org/repo-name`. If personal, use `repo-name` alone.

### Step 3 — Set up main branch

```bash
git checkout -b main
git push origin main
git checkout develop             # Return to develop as default
```

### Step 4 — Configure branch protection and CODEOWNERS (optional, recommended)

Remind the user to configure the following in GitHub Settings → Branches:

**CODEOWNERS activation:**
- CODEOWNERS is already generated at `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- To activate it: enable "Require review from Code Owners" in branch protection rules

**Branch protection rules:**
- `develop` branch: require PR review (1 reviewer), require CODEOWNERS review, require status checks (sf-validate workflow), require branches to be up to date before merging
- `main` branch: require PR review (2 reviewers), require CODEOWNERS review, require status checks, restrict pushers to release managers

> **Note:** Branch protection can be configured via `gh api` if the user wants it automated. Ask if they'd like that.

### Step 5 — Present git summary

After setup, show:
- Remote URL
- Default branch (`develop`)
- Branches created (`main`, `develop`)
- Next step: clone on second consultant machine or set up DevHub authentication

## Phase 4: Linear Auto-Creation

**Auto-execute all steps in this phase immediately after Phase 3/3.5 without prompting the user.**
The Linear project structure is created automatically as part of scaffolding. No approval step needed —
the structure was already confirmed in the Phase 2 summary.

After file generation, use the Linear MCP to create the engagement tracking structure.

### Create Linear Project
Use `save_project` to create a project under team Rihm (`dfe15bc4-6dd0-4bde-8609-6620efc3140d`):
- Name: `[Client Name] - [Project Name]`
- Description: Generated from interview answers

**Important:** After creating the project, capture the returned project ID and update CLAUDE.md Section 1 with:
- `Linear Project ID: {returned-id}`
- `Linear Project Name: [Client Name] - [Project Name]`

This enables automatic Linear ticket pulls during session startup (Section 8).

### Create Milestones
Use `save_milestone` to create milestones based on entry point. Set target dates using the timeline captured in Round 4 (calculate from the project start date):

**Greenfield:**
- Discovery — end of Week 2
- Design — end of Week 2
- Build — end of Week 8 (covers 3 sprints)
- Test — end of Week 10
- Deploy — end of Week 12
- Go-Live — end of Week 12
- Hypercare — 2 weeks post go-live

**Build Phase:** Design → Build → Test → Deploy → Go-Live → Hypercare
(Set dates based on sprint cadence captured in Round 4)

**Managed Services:** Assessment → Stabilize → Ongoing Support
(Set dates based on SLA terms and timeline from Round 4)

**Rescue:** Assessment → Remediation → Stabilize → Build → Test → Deploy
(Set urgency-adjusted dates from Round 4 urgency level)

### Create Initial Issues
Use `save_issue` to create issues derived from interview answers:
- Assign to the user (Michael Rihm: `8d75f0a6-f848-41af-9f4b-d06036d6af82`)
- Set appropriate priority based on entry point urgency
- Link to milestones
- Use labels from `list_issue_labels`

### Sprint Cycles
Sprint cycles are managed directly in Linear UI. Milestones above serve as the primary structural grouping for tracking engagement progress.

## Phase 5: Post-Creation

After all files are created and Linear is set up:

1. Present the **final summary** of everything created (files, Linear project, issues)
2. Remind the user to configure MCP servers if not already set up:
   - `salesforcecli/mcp` — install instructions
   - Verify Linear, Context7, Playwright MCPs are active
   - **Branch protection reminder:** Remind the user that `.github/CODEOWNERS` has been generated but requires branch protection to be enabled in GitHub Settings → Branches to take effect. Point them to `GETTING_STARTED.md` for step-by-step instructions.
3. Based on entry point:
   - **Greenfield:** Begin the Discovery workflow — start requirements gathering
   - **Build Phase:** Review existing requirements, start sprint planning
   - **Managed Services:** Begin org health assessment
   - **Rescue:** Begin audit — code review, security assessment, technical debt catalog
4. Show open backlog items and ask what to work on first

## External Tool Recommendations

Present these to the user during or after initialization:

### Required MCP
- **salesforcecli/mcp** (Official Salesforce DX MCP, 309+ stars) — Deploy, retrieve metadata, manage scratch orgs, run Apex tests via natural language commands through Claude Code

### Optional Tools
- **Jaganpro/sf-skills** (163+ stars) — 14 specialized Claude Code skills for Salesforce development (Apex, LWC, Flow, SOQL, etc.) by a Salesforce CTA. Consider installing for deeper SF-specific guidance
- **tsmztech/mcp-server-salesforce** (135+ stars) — Community MCP for SOQL queries, CRUD operations, and metadata API access. Useful when you need deeper org interaction beyond what the official MCP provides

## Key Reminders

- **Always interview first.** Never skip to file creation.
- **Present recommendations.** For every decision point, give your best recommendation first with rationale, plus 1-2 alternatives.
- **Approval before creation.** Always show the creation summary and wait for "go ahead."
- **Entry-point awareness.** Adapt interview depth, deliverable defaults, Linear milestones, and CI/CD setup based on the entry point.
- **Shared repo model.** This engagement will have multiple consultants. Include .gitignore patterns, branch protection recommendations, and CODEOWNERS guidance.
- **Data model changes always require confirmation.** Never create or modify Salesforce objects, fields, or relationships without explicit user approval.
- **Use Context7 for live docs.** When writing Apex, LWC, or SFDX commands, use Context7 MCP to verify current API signatures and patterns.
